# Road Fighter

The road fighter game concept has been inspired by the road fighter game itself and snake game. Collect all coins before the time runs out and win the game.
The player will need to navigate his/her way through the traffic. He can dodge the other cars or avoid them while the player is collecting each coin. If the player collides with any of the block, then the game is over. You need to avoid the blocks at all costs. Once all coins have been collected then the player wins.

## PURPOSE OF OBJECTS AND FEATURE IN PLAY

- Car player – the goal is to collect all coins to win the game.
- Coins – the player earn points each time it is collected and wins the game when mission is complete.
- Traffic cars – to play as the distraction and make it difficult to the player to collect the coins.
- Roadblocks – obstacles that the player needs to avoid at all cost or it ends the game.
